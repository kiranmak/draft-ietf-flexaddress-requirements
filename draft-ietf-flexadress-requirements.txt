     Requirements Considerations for Flexible IoT Device Addressing
               draft-ietf-flexaddress-requirements-latest

Abstract

   Industry Control Networks are classified as limited-domains because
   their scope is limited to a controlled network environment Such
   networks host a a diverse set of non Internet protocol for use use.
   The industrial networks demand their own specific requirements to
   operate between Internet and non-Internet protocols.  One particular
   problem is the figuring out address space for such networks.

1.  Introduction

   Industry control networks are increasingly becoming complex as the
   emphasis on convergence of OT/IT grows.  Operational Technologies
   networks are tied to set of non-Internet protocols such as Modbus,
   Profibus, CANbus, Profines, etc.

2.  Analysis

   ## Issue 1

   *  a suggested title or name for the issue

   *  a long-term pointer to the best reference describing the issue

   *  a short description of the nature of the issue and its impact on
      media quality of service, including:

      -  where in the network this issue has root causes

      -  who can detect this issue when it occurs ## Prevalence Practics

   *  an overview of the issue's known prevalence in practice.  pointers
      to write-ups of high-profile incidents are a plus.

   *  a list of known mitigation techniques, with (for each known
      mitigation):

      -  a name for the mitigation technique

      -  a long-term pointer to the best reference describing it

      -  a short description of the technique:

         o  what it does

         o  where in the network it operates

         o  an overview of the tradeoffs involved--how and why it's
            helpful, what it costs.

      -  supplemental information about the technique's deployment
         prevalence and status

2.1.  Scope Address Space

3.  Requirements

3.1.  Requirement identifier

4.  IANA Considerations
